## 🚀 About Me
- 📚 Once: Physics & Math teacher (yes, I still solve integrals for fun).  
- 💻 Now: Data science explorer — machine learning, GenAI, and storytelling with numbers.  
- 🎯 Goal: Build models that don’t just predict, but explain.  
- 🧠 Side quests: philosophy, psychology, history, creative writing.
