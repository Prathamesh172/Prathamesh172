  <em>From Physics to Data Science — building models, stories, and impact.</em>

## 🚀 About Me
- 📚 Once: Physics & Math teacher (yes, I still solve integrals for fun).  
- 💻 Now: Data science explorer — machine learning, GenAI, and storytelling with numbers.  
- 🎯 Goal: Build models that don’t just predict, but explain.  
- 🧠 Side quests: philosophy, psychology, history, creative writing.

## 🎯 2025 Roadmap
- Build **2 production-grade ML apps** (with CI/CD + Docker).  
- Master **MLOps basics**.  
- Land a **Data Scientist role** by year’s end.  
- Keep writing: essays, poetry, and maybe a book someday.

## ✨ Fun Side
- 🕶 If you don’t find me coding, I’m either writing weird one-liners, reading old philosophy texts, or roasting my own past code.  
- 🤖 I like AI that is practical, interpretable, and actually useful.  
- 🌀 Guiding thought: *“Clarity beats complexity.”*
