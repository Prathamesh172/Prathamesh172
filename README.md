# 👋 Hey there, I’m Prathamesh (@Prathamesh172)

Welcome to my corner of the internet—where physics meets code, and data tells stories.
A teacher by profession, a data scientist by obsession, and a lifelong student by choice.

## 👀 I’m interested in...

* Turning messy data into meaningful insights 🧠📊
* Building intelligent systems that *actually* solve problems
* Large Language Models, Generative AI, and the future of AI 👨‍🔬🧩
* Making models explainable, interpretable, and just plain cool
* Exploring the edges of ML, AI, and human behavior
* Discussing philosophy, psychology, and the occasional absurdity of life ☕

## 🌱 I’m currently learning...

* Large Language Models (LLMs), Transformers, and Generative AI (GPT, BERT, LangChain, etc.)
* Deep Learning with TensorFlow & PyTorch (yes, the *real* stuff)
* Time Series Analysis & Forecasting (long live seasonality)
* End-to-end ML pipelines: from raw data to deployment
* Building interactive dashboards with Streamlit & Dash
* SQL (finally... I know, I know 😅)
* Balancing rigor with creativity in every project I build
* Making projects production-ready: deployment, APIs, and the whole shebang
* And every odd idea that keeps me up at 2 AM 🥴

## 💞 I’m looking to collaborate on...

* Data Science projects with real-world impact
* Freelance gigs (open to remote collaborations)
* Resume screening tools, health/finance analytics, or educational tech
* Anything crazy enough to be interesting but smart enough to make sense

## 😄 Pronouns:

He/Him (but I respond to "Hey genius", "Bro", and occasionally "Sir" when teaching)

## ⚡ Fun fact:

I once solved a tough math problem during a power cut by candlelight… and then forgot to write it down. Enlightenment is temporary—document your code.
