# Hi, I'm Prathamesh 👋
**M.Sc. Physics — now building things in Data Science | Teacher turned data-nerd**  
I solve messy real-world problems with data, ML, and a bit of stubborn curiosity.

- 🔭 Currently: transitioning to full-time Data Science / ML role — building portfolio projects, practicing interviews.
- 🌱 Learning: Deep learning, model deployment, MLOps, GenAI.
- 💡 Interests: philosophy, psychology, history, productivity, creative writing.
- 📫 Reach me: prathameshugle39@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be (and sometimes still am) dramatic — but it helps in storytelling with data.
